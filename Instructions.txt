These are basic instructions on how to use the program. At this stage, I would
assume that you have installed 'pymongo' and the mongoDB on your system. Please
refer to the internet on instructions for your particular system.

    NOTE: THIS SOFTWARE WAS NEVER BETA TESTED.

This software was intended to be used for my own personal use. However, as it
demonstrates my Python coding skills, I made the decision to make it public.

The map itself is drawn in IMSI TurboCad 19. This is a paid program, where
the data format is proprietary. TurboCad does offer alternative formats, however
the data losses are not acceptable. During the conversions, the properties of
my objects (like the attached name of the town) are lost. TurboCad allows me to
attach the name to the object: with a click on the object, I am able to view
the name I assigned to it.

1.) Recover my backed up data into the database. This will give you the most
    up to date data. This data is not sensitive, but may contain geographic
    place-names with personal significance. Some place-names are randomly
    generated by the system.
    (NOTE: I have never needed to recover the data, hence I'm unable to advise
    on the process)

1b.)If you want to start off fresh, run "python my_world.py". A text-based menu
    will become available. Select option '!' to load the 'static' information
    into the database.
    * To test the installation, I would suggest requesting a random name. Select
    option '`' (back-tick) from the menu. Follow the on-screen prompts.
