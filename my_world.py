""" 'Grzeg's World' is a fictional world drawing assistance tool. It assists
you with the geo-political tasks. You draw your political divisions on the map;
you then enter them into this software. A name will be suggested prior to
storing it with MongoDB. Your name is entered in two writing systems, which are
UTF-8 encoded.

The software assumes 1930's technology by default: Hence there is no magic. If
you intend to use the software for your magic filled world, go ahead, I won't be
offended.

When you get down to your agricultural areas, you simply tell the software the
area on the map: 'Grzeg's World' will give you the number of workers needed for
that land. Those farm workers live in a village: The village has doctors,
policemen, fire-chiefs, teachers, ... those households will can be added
automatically to the village. Your agricultural village grows wheat, for
example. At 5 tons per hectare, the software does the yield calculation for
you. Your village with its fields, is grouped into a municipalitity. A group of
municipalities is called a 'County'.

Each county has a 'capital town', which itself is a municipalitity too. The
'capital town' handle the 'collective' elements of your agricultural villages.
Elements like a rail depo where the grain from the farms is shipped to other
parts of the country. There could also be a hospital in the town, where the
village only has a clinic. The capital town would have some small industrial
components: perhaps a flour mill, or a mechanic?

Counties are grouped into Distrcts. Districts are quite importaint cities. Each
District has its own capital too. Once again, more specialised services are
available there.

Districts are grouped into Provinces; Provinces are grouped into Countries;
Countries are grouped into the World.

Eariler I mentioned the 'capital town'. It is in a municipalitity: an urban
municipalitity. A municipalitity can be sub-divided into a maximum of 36
Sections. [... it seems like my 'suburbs' got lost in the system. Well, I
haven't tested this work in progress to that level yet!].

I mentioned the number '36' earlier on. Note that every division has a maximum
of 36 sub-divisions. This is due to the 'geo-code' (geographic coding system)
which uses a base-36 system. A base-36 system looks like this:
0 to 9 then A to Z.

Country, Provincial and District geo-codes are independent of each other. Below
the district, there is inheretance of the geo-code. A county with the code 'GYN'
is in the 'GY' district. As we get lower down the hierarchy, our code grows.
After 3 alpha-numeric characters, we introduce a hyphen to make it easier to
read.
